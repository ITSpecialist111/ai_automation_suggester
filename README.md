An **AI‚Äëpowered assistant** for Home Assistant that leverages large language models to understand your unique smart home environment ‚Äì your entities, areas, devices, **and** existing automations. It proposes intelligent, actionable YAML suggestions tailored to your specific setup, helping you unlock your home's full potential.

---

## ‚ú® Why does this exist? (Purpose and Problem Statement)

As your Home Assistant setup grows, managing its complexity and identifying new opportunities for automation can become challenging. You might find yourself with:

* **Too many possibilities:** Every new device adds countless potential interactions.
* **Automation "Writer's Block":** Translating a complex idea into functional YAML can be daunting.
* **Underutilized Potential:** Many devices sit idle or require manual control because the right automation hasn't been thought of or created.
* **Maintenance Overload:** Keeping existing automations relevant as your home evolves is difficult.

The result is often an **under-automated house** despite having powerful hardware.

### The Fix ‚Äì Your Personal Automation Copilot

The AI Automation Suggester integration solves these challenges by acting as a personal automation consultant. It intelligently analyzes your Home Assistant instance to:

1.  **Analyze your home's state:** Understand your devices, their capabilities, locations, and existing automations.
2.  **Identify opportunities:** Spot gaps, synergies, and potential improvements for energy saving, security, comfort, and convenience.
3.  **Draft ready-to-paste YAML:** Provide concrete, tailored automation ideas as YAML snippets you can review, tweak, and implement directly.

**In essence,** this integration turns the complexity of a large Home Assistant environment into actionable insights and tangible benefits, guiding you toward a more efficient, comfortable, and secure smart home.

---

## üöÄ How It Works (The Solution)

The integration follows a simple, effective process:

| Step | What happens? | Details |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **1&nbsp;¬∑ Snapshot** | Collects data about your home. | On manual trigger or schedule, the integration gathers information on your entities (including attributes), devices, areas, **and** existing automations. You can control the scope using filters and limits. |
| **2&nbsp;¬∑ Prompt Building** | Structures the data for the AI. | This snapshot is embedded into a detailed system prompt describing your specific Home Assistant setup. You can enhance this with a *custom prompt* to steer suggestions towards specific goals (e.g., "focus on presence lighting"). |
| **3&nbsp;¬∑ Provider Call** | Sends the prompt to the AI. | The crafted prompt is sent to your configured AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, LocalAI, Ollama, Mistral, Perplexity). |
| **4&nbsp;¬∑ Parsing** | Processes the AI's response. | The raw response from the AI is parsed to extract key information: a human-readable `description` of the suggestion, the actual `yaml_block` code, and potentially other details. This information is stored on sensor attributes. |
| **5&nbsp;¬∑ Surface** | Delivers the suggestions. | Suggestions appear as Home Assistant persistent notifications. You can also use sensor attributes to display suggestions on custom dashboards for easy review and implementation. |

Randomized entity selection (configurable) helps ensure each analysis run can surface fresh ideas rather than repeating the same suggestions.

---

## Customization and Advanced Usage

Beyond the basic configuration and service call parameters, you can further customize the integration's behavior:

### Random Entity Selection

By default, the integration uses randomized entity selection when `all_entities` is `true` (or the automatic weekly scan runs). This helps ensure variety in suggestions and prevents the AI from focusing only on the same initial set of entities.

### Domain Filtering

Use the `domains` parameter in the service call or your automation configuration to narrow the focus. This is very effective for getting suggestions for specific areas (e.g., only analyze `light` and `switch` entities in the `living_room` area - though area filtering is implicit based on the entities selected).

### Entity Limit

The `entity_limit` parameter is crucial for managing prompt size, particularly with models sensitive to input length or cost. Experiment to find a limit that provides good suggestions without hitting token limits or incurring excessive costs.

### Custom Prompts

The `custom_prompt` parameter allows you to be very specific about the type of suggestions you want for a particular run. Combine it with domain filtering for highly targeted results (e.g., `domains: ['climate'], custom_prompt: "Suggest automations to optimize heating/cooling based on occupancy and weather."`).

---

## Implementing Automations

1.  **Review Suggestions:** Check the persistent notifications or your dashboard card for new suggestions.
2.  **Copy YAML:** The suggestions are provided as ready-to-use Home Assistant YAML snippets. Copy the `yaml_block` content.
3.  **Add to Home Assistant:**
    * Paste the YAML into your `automations.yaml` file and restart Home Assistant.
    * Alternatively, use the Home Assistant Automation Editor UI: create a new automation, switch to YAML mode, and paste the snippet.
4.  **Adapt as Needed:** While the suggestions are tailored, you may need to make minor adjustments to triggers, conditions, delays, or actions to perfectly match your preferences and devices.
5.  **Test:** Always test new automations to ensure they function as expected before relying on them.

---

## Sensors

The integration provides two key sensors for monitoring:

* **AI Automation Suggestions Sensor:** `sensor.ai_automation_suggestions_<provider_name>`
    * State indicates the status (e.g., `idle`, `generating`, `suggestions_available`).
    * Attributes contain the latest suggestions, including `description`, `yaml_block`, and potentially other details depending on the AI provider's response format.
* **AI Provider Status Sensor:** `sensor.ai_provider_status_<provider_name>`
    * State indicates the connection health (e.g., `connected`, `error`, `unavailable`).
    * Attributes may provide additional details about the provider status or any errors encountered.

Monitor these sensors to ensure the integration is functioning correctly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Privacy Considerations:** If using cloud-based AI providers, be aware that entity data (names, states, attributes) is sent to their servers. Consider using local AI models (LocalAI, Ollama) for full data control if privacy is a major concern.
* **API Costs:** Some cloud providers charge for API usage based on tokens processed. Be mindful of this and use features like `entity_limit` and scheduled run frequency to manage potential costs. Monitor your provider's billing.
* **No Guarantees:** The AI's suggestions are based on patterns and logical inference from the data provided. They are not guaranteed to be perfect or the most efficient solution for every scenario. **Always review suggestions thoroughly before implementing them in your live system.**
* **AI Limitations:** Large language models can sometimes hallucinate or provide illogical suggestions. Use your judgment and knowledge of your home setup when reviewing.

## üß© Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                 | Check / Action                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No suggestions available** | - Verify API key is correct.<br>- Check the `AI Provider Status` sensor for errors.<br>- Check the Home Assistant logs for errors related to the integration.<br>- Try triggering the service manually with a small `entity_limit` and no domain filters.<br>- Ensure you have enough entities/devices for meaningful suggestions. |
| **AI Provider Status shows `error`** | - Inspect the Home Assistant log (`home-assistant.log`) for detailed error messages (look for `ai_automation_suggester` and `processing error`).<br>- Check your network connection to the provider's server (if cloud-based) or your local server.<br>- Confirm your API key is active and has permissions.<br>- Ensure your local AI server is running and accessible. |
| **Suggestion prompt is too long** | - Reduce the `entity_limit` parameter when triggering the service or configuring the automation.<br>- Use the `domains` filter to narrow the scope of entities analyzed.<br>- Shorten or simplify your `custom_prompt` if you are using one. |
| **Unintended startup suggestions** | - Review your Home Assistant automations and scripts to ensure none are configured to call `ai_automation_suggester.generate_suggestions` on startup or via events you didn't intend. |
| **Suggestions are repetitive** | - Ensure `all_entities` is used (e.g., in a weekly automation) and consider enabling randomized entity selection.<br>- Try different `custom_prompt` values to steer the AI in a new direction.<br>- Increase the `entity_limit` to give the AI more data points (if prompt length allows). |
| **Image links are broken in HACS/GitHub** | This has been addressed in this README version. Ensure the README file in your repository uses the corrected URLs provided. Clear your browser cache or wait for GitHub/HACS to refresh. |

If you encounter issues not covered here, please open an issue on the GitHub repository with details from your Home Assistant logs.
